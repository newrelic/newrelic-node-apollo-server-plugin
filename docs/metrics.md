# Metrics

Two new metrics have been introduced to understand the behavior of your GraphQL operations within and across transactions. Read more on those below or jump down to the [Visualizations](#visualizations) section to see some recommended ways to use this data.

For more information on querying metrics and creating charts, see the [Resources](#resources) section.

## Operation Metrics

`/GraphQL/operation/ApolloServer/[operation-type]/[operation-name]/[deepest-unique-path]`

Operation metrics include the operation type, operation name and deepest-path. These metrics represent the durations of the individual queries or mutations and can be used to compare outside of the context of individual transactions which may have multiple queries.

**Operation Type:** Indicates if the operation was a query or a mutation.

**Operation Name:** The operation name when provided or `<anonymous>`.

**Deepest Unique Path:** The deepest path included in the selection set of a query where only one field was selected at each level. Since operation names may be reused, this helps further determine uniqueness of a given operation. See the description on the [transactions](./transactions.md#deepest-unique-path) page for more details.

## Field Resolve Metrics

`/GraphQL/resolve/ApolloServer/[field-name]`

Resolve metrics capture the duration spent resolving a particular piece of requested GraphQL data. These can be useful to find specific resolvers that may contribute to slowing down incoming queries.

These differ slightly in naming from their segment/span counterparts. Be better visualize relationships, the full path to a field is represented in segments/spans (i.e. libraries.books.title). To understand the duration aggregated across all usages and transactions, the metric uses the field name without the full path.

## Visualizations

Here is a collection of useful queries that leverage these new metrics to better understand the behaviors of your Apollo GraphQL applications.

### Top 10 Operations

If you would like to have a list of the top 10 slowest operations, the following query can be used to pull the data on demand or as a part of a dashboard.

```
FROM Metric SELECT average(newrelic.timeslice.value) * 1000 WHERE appName = '[YOUR APP NAME]' WITH METRIC_FORMAT 'GraphQL/operation/ApolloServer/{operation}' FACET operation LIMIT 10
```

The 'Bar' chart type makes a nice visualization similar to the transaction overview you may be used to.

A 'Table' chart type may also be useful showing a breakdown of operations. For this scenario, we recommend leveraging the METRIC_FORMAT to give further sorting and visualization flexibility. The following query will generate columns of operation type, operation name, deepest-path and 'AVG Duration (MS)' to sort and examine as you wish.

```
FROM Metric SELECT average(newrelic.timeslice.value) * 1000 as 'AVG Duration (MS)' WHERE appName = '[YOUR APP NAME]' WITH METRIC_FORMAT 'GraphQL/operation/ApolloServer/{type}/{name}/{deepest-path}' FACET type, name, `deepest-path` LIMIT 20
```

### Average Operation Time

You may also wish to track the average duration over time for operations. To do this, a very similar query may be used leveraging `TIMESERIES`.

```
FROM Metric SELECT average(newrelic.timeslice.value) WHERE appName = '[YOUR APP NAME]' WITH METRIC_FORMAT 'GraphQL/operation/ApolloServer/{operation}' TIMESERIES FACET operation
```

This is best viewed with the 'Line' chart type which allows for viewing all operations or toggling visualization of individual operations.

### Top 10 Resolvers

If you would like to have a list of the top 10 slowest resolves, the following query can be used to pull the data on demand or as a part of a dashboard.

```
FROM Metric
SELECT average(newrelic.timeslice.value) * 1000 as 'Average Duration (MS)' WHERE appName = '[YOUR APP NAME]' WITH METRIC_FORMAT 'GraphQL/resolve/ApolloServer/{field}' FACET field LIMIT 20
```

The 'Bar' chart type makes a nice visualization similar to the transaction overview you may be used to. The 'Table' chart type may also be useful showing a breakdown of field and 'Average Duration (MS)' in a table.

### Average Resolver Time

You may also wish to track the average duration over time for resolvers. To do this, a very similar query may be used leveraging `TIMESERIES`.

```
FROM Metric
SELECT average(newrelic.timeslice.value) * 1000 as 'Average Duration (MS)' TIMESERIES WHERE appName = '[YOUR APP NAME]' WITH METRIC_FORMAT 'GraphQL/resolve/ApolloServer/{field}' FACET field
```

This is best viewed with the 'Line' chart type which allows for viewing all operations or toggling visualization of individual operations.
